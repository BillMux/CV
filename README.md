# William Muxworthy


After finishing my degree in Music Technology from Leeds Metropolitan University, I began working in the events industry, mainly as a general member of crew. This gave me plenty of hands-on experience in the technical side of events. I then spent a few months working as a van driver for luxury floristry company OnlyRoses, from which I gained valuable experience in working under strict time pressure.

In the past few months I've developed an interest in coding, and in the summer began practising a few basic Ruby skills, mainly through casual pairing sessions with friends and some evenings messing around on codewars. I also ran through a crash course in HTML and CSS, through which I designed a few different frameworks for basic blog sites.

I'm currently a student at Makers Academy, hoping to kickstart a new career in Web Development or Programming.

###### Languages I've worked with:
Ruby, HTML, CSS


## Skills


#### Time management

During my time as a delivery driver for luxury floristry company OnlyRoses, my main responsibility was to ensure all deliveries are made within a strict timeframe. This involved very careful route planning and organisation, as well as a considerable amount of patience.

Above all, I learned to stay calm in an often stressful work environment. Many of the flower arrangements were extremely delicate, so I needed to make sure I started my route in enough time to drive slowly and carefully.

#### Team work and collaboration

I have worked in many positions where team work is essential. When I worked for event crew companies Connection and Pinnacle, the majority of shifts involved a large objective split into multiple smaller tasks, which would usually be carried out in pairs. As a result, this way of working is very familiar to me and I have a great understanding of how two people can communicate and collaborate their way towards a common goal. After about a year working for them, Connection Crew promoted me from General Crew to Elite Crew, placing me in more of a leading position. However, I would still tend to prefer working as part of the team over authoritative roles.
