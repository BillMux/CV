## Bill Muxworthy

In the past few months I've developed an interest in coding, and began practising a few basic Ruby skills, mainly through casual pairing sessions with friends and a fair few evenings on codewars.

I'm currently a student at Makers Academy, hoping to kickstart a new career in Web Development or Programming.

###### Languages I've worked with:
Ruby, HTML, CSS
