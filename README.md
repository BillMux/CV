# Bill Muxworthy


I am a graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech), where I’ve been immersed in test-driven approaches to writing well-written and maintainable code. I discovered programming after graduating with a BSc in Music Technology and started to build some websites with HTML and CSS and testing my abilities on sites like Codewars and HackerRank. Through this, I discovered a craft I want to learn everything about while contributing to a wider tech team and product. 

###### Languages I've worked with:
Ruby, JavaScript (ES5 and ES6), HTML, CSS, SQL, Python, React Native, ERB, Haskell

## Skills

#### Commitment

I am driven to work with calm urgency until a problem is solved. That satisfaction after struggling to find a solution is what I strive for when I work. What I love about coding is that these moments come along very frequently. Every time my test suite comes back showing green, I feel I have accomplished one task. This is what provides me with the commitment to continue to wrestle with challenging problems until I see those passing tests.

#### Collaboration

Similar to writing code, as a bass player I practice, writing parts alone, then go to collaborate on it with my band. We continue to gig together and recently won competition gigs to play at Bloodstock festival and Isle of Wight festival. I’ve worked as part of professional teams both as a sound engineer, Head of Tech for a radio station, in an events crew team and in a customer facing role as a delivery driver after University. This has helped me work with any project team at Makers, where we paired daily or worked in larger teams using Agile methodologies which emphasise great communication and feedback. 

#### Time management

As a delivery driver for luxury floristry company OnlyRoses, my main responsibility was to ensure all deliveries are made within a strict time-frame. This involved very careful route planning and organisation, as well as a considerable amounts of patience. Above all, I learned to stay calm in an often stressful work environment. I have been able to take this attitude of calmness while remaining mindful of time constraints into tech projects teams where sprints have time limits and pre-defined outcomes.
