# Bill Muxworthy


I am a graduate of Makers where I’ve been immersed in test-driven approaches to writing well-written and maintainable code. I discovered programming after graduating with a BSc in Music Technology and started to build some websites with HTML and CSS and playing with Codewars. Through this, I discovered a craft I want to learn everything about while contributing to a wider tech team and product. 

###### Languages I've worked with:
Ruby, JavaScript (ES5 and ES6), HTML, CSS, SQL, Python, React Native, ERB, Haskell

## Skills

#### Commitment

My study of bass guitar took me to a degree in Music Technology where I also got to work as a composer and producer. Dedicating myself to music has helped develop an inner commitment to writing good code which also often means working alone with dedication to solve a problem. Working to master a piece of music has developed grit to stay with particularly tricky problems and refining a composition has many similarities to refactoring a piece of code.

#### Collaboration

Similar to writing code, as a bass player I practice, writing parts alone, then go to collaborate on it with my band. We continue to gig together and recently won competition gigs to play at Bloodstock festival and Isle of Wight festival. I’ve worked as part of professional teams both as a sound engineer, Head of Tech for a radio station, in an events crew team and in a customer facing role as a delivery driver after University. This has helped me work with any project team at Makers, where we paired daily or worked in larger teams using Agile methodologies which emphasise great communication and feedback. 

#### Time management

As a delivery driver for luxury floristry company OnlyRoses, my main responsibility was to ensure all deliveries are made within a strict time-frame. This involved very careful route planning and organisation, as well as a considerable amounts of patience. Above all, I learned to stay calm in an often stressful work environment. I have been able to take this attitude of calmness while remaining mindful of time constraints into tech projects teams where sprints have time limits and pre-defined outcomes.
